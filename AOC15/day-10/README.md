## Part 1

The Elves are playing a game called **look-and-say**. Starting from an initial sequence of digits, the next sequence is generated by "reading aloud" the previous sequence: Count consecutive digits and say the count followed by the digit. For example: `1` becomes `11` (one 1), `11` becomes `21` (two 1s), `21` becomes `1211` (one 2, one 1), `1211` becomes `111221` (one 1, one 2, two 1s), `111221` becomes `312211` (three 1s, two 2s, one 1).

Starting from the input sequence `1321131112`, this transformation is applied **40 times**. The goal is to compute the **length** of the resulting sequence.

**Example**

Input:
```
1
```

After 5 iterations:
```
312211
```

Output:
```
6
```

### Idea
We go through the digits and count how many times each digit repeats in a row, then say the count followed by the digit to form a new string. We repeat this 40 times and finally return how long that last string is.

## Part 2

Now, the same transformation is applied **50 times** starting again from the initial input. The task is to compute the **length** of the final result.

### Idea
It's the exact same as Part 1, just with 50 rounds instead of 40. We run the same logic and return the final string's length.
